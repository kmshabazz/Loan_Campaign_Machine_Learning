# Loan_Campaign_Machine_Learning
Analyze customer data to identify key attributes influencing loan acquisition. Build a predictive model to capture patterns and target high-potential loan buyers. This will help the bank improve marketing efforts, optimize outreach, and increase conversion rates by focusing on customers likely to purchase loans.
